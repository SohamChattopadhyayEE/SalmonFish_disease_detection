# Cardiac disease detection in Salmon fishes
Cardiac diseases in salmon significantly affect Norway’s economy. An estimated loss of more than € 25 million was attributed to cardiomyopathy syndrome in salmon in 2007 and the numbers are increasing steadily. Cardiomyopathy syndrome  traditionally  manifests  itself  in salmon  12  to  18  months  after  transfer  to  seawater,  and affected  fish  frequently  die  without  any  prior  clinical signs of the disease. Scientists are working on finding ways of studying the behaviour of infected salmon heart in contrast to healthy one. This shall potentially help in detecting the disease in salmon fishes as early possible such that the economic loss can be addressed up to a certain extent. 
  The objective of this paper is to classify salmon hearts are infected on otherwise by using videos of embryonic heart to identify various physical parameters that allow classification. In this present study, controlled eggs of salmon fishes are embryonated and their embryonic hearts are put under observation. Furthermore different videos at different time frames are recorded which provides valuable information about the changes of behaviours of embryonic hearts. Thereafter, based on certain attributes extracted from this data, various predictive artificial intelligence models are used for the classification purpose.
